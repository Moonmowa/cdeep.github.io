            <h2>Profile Summary</h2>
            <p>A passionate and dedicated Front-End Developer focused on building efficient, engaging, and dynamic user experiences.<br>
                <span class="highlight">With 5.6 years of hands-on experience</span> in modern web technologies such as React, Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, Iâ€™ve delivered impactful applications across industries, including ERP, travel booking, e-commerce, finance, and 5G networks.<br>
                I graduated from <span class="highlight">Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, Tirupati</span>, in 2019. During my last semester, I had the exciting opportunity to intern at <span class="highlight">Circle Square Technologies</span>, a small startup based in Bangalore. Working in a team of five, I gained valuable insights into client interaction and requirements gathering, while also developing my technical abilities.<br>
                One of my key projects at Circle Square was <span class="highlight">SmartERP</span>, initially developed in AngularJS. After joining full-time, I contributed to <span class="highlight">migrating SmartERP to Angular 7</span>, working on the development from scratch and focusing on the front end. This experience strengthened my foundation in development and equipped me with the skills to tackle complex projects independently.</p>
