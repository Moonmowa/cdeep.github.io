                    A passionate and dedicated Front-End Developer focused on building efficient, engaging, and dynamic user experiences.<br />
                    <span class="highlight">
                        With 5.6 years of hands-on experience
                    </span> in modern web technologies such as React, Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, Iâ€™ve delivered impactful applications across industries, including ERP, travel booking, e-commerce, finance, and 5G networks.<br/>
                    I graduated from 
                    <span class="highlight">Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, Tirupati
                        </span>, in 2019. During my last semester, I had the exciting opportunity to intern at
                        <span class="highlight">Circle Square Technologies</span>, a small startup based in Bangalore. Working in a team of five, I gained valuable insights into client interaction and requirements gathering, while also developing my technical abilities.<br/>
                    One of my key projects at Circle Square was
                    <span class="highlight">SmartERP</span>
                    , initially developed in AngularJS. After joining full-time, I contributed to <span class="highlight">migrating SmartERP to Angular 7</span>, working on the development from scratch and focusing on the front end. This experience strengthened my foundation in development and equipped me with the skills to tackle complex projects independently.
